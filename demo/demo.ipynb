    "## About the Data\n",
    "The data used in this demo is sourced from OpenAerialMap and OpenStreetMap (OSM). We will use an aerial imagery scene downloaded from [OpenAerialMap](https://map.openaerialmap.org/#/34.745614528656006,3.7642264421477485,15/square/12233202121301210/6447e8162155f0000546362b?_k=0r8ow6), which covers a portion of the Kalobeyei Integrated Settlement Camp 2. This scene is provided as a GeoTIFF file and is divided into two spatially disjoint areas: one for training and validation, and the other for testing (Figure 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the bounds of the aerial imagery scene to extract features from OpenStreetMap using the `osmnx` package. Specifically, we retrieve features with the following OSM tags:\n",
    "- `building=True`\n",
    "- `generator:source=solar`\n",
    "- `amenity=toilets`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that toilets in this area may be tagged either with `building=toilets` or `amenity=toilets`, so we retrieve features with both tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw OSM features do not perfectly align with our imagery scene (Figure 2). To correct this, we use QGIS to manually adjust the polygon features to align with the buildings visible in the imagery. Additionally, the `amenity=toilets` features are returned as point geometries (shown as green dots in Figure 2). We use QGIS to buffer these points into square polygons and align them with the visible toilet structures before merging them with the other polygon layer (Figure 3). We also manually label numerous toilets and solar panels that were not initially labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also draw polygons to represent background areas without buildings, solar panels, or toilets, and label some background points over objects like cars, fences, hedges, and wells to serve as hard negative samples.\n",

    "In this section, we will train a U-Net model with a `resnext50_32x4d` backbone on the prepared dataset. The U-Net architecture is popular for semantic segmentation due to its ability to capture both spatial and contextual information, while the `resnext50_32x4d` backbone is a popular feature extractor. While we are using this specific setup, other architectures and backbones can also be used.\n",

    "For this demo, we will use cross-entropy loss, which is commonly used for multi-class classification problems. Cross-entropy loss measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. However, other loss functions like Jaccard loss (also known as Intersection over Union loss) can be used to optimize the model further, especially in cases where the dataset is imbalanced or where the overlap between predicted and actual segments is critical. For this demo, we will use pixelwise cross-entropy loss, which measures the performance of a model by comparing the predicted class probability for each pixel to the true class label. Other loss functions like Jaccard loss can also be used for further optimization.\n",
